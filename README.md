## üìò Project Overview

This project applies **advanced Data Science and statistical modeling techniques** to analyze and forecast **weekly mortality data** from Spain between 2010 and 2024.
The study uses official data from the **Spanish National Statistics Institute (INE)** and focuses on identifying **trends, seasonal structures, and volatility patterns** in mortality behavior, while also quantifying the **impact of the COVID-19 pandemic**.

The analysis is conducted entirely in **R**, following a complete **data science workflow**: data preprocessing, exploratory visualization, model fitting (ARIMA and GARCH), forecast generation, and diagnostic validation.

* **Variable:** Estimated weekly deaths by province and gender
* **Period:** 2010‚Äì2024 (first 52 weeks per year)
* **Frequency:** Weekly (52 observations per year)
* **Encoding:** ISO-8859-1; decimal separator ‚Äú,‚Äù
* **Associated metadata:** `CorrespondenciaNIUvsCCAAvsSEXO (1).xlsx`

## ‚öôÔ∏è Methodology

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Exploratory and Descriptive Analysis

* Filtered the dataset to retain **52 weeks per year (2010‚Äì2023)**.
* Calculated **global mean** and **52-week moving average** to identify trends.
* Detected a **significant upward trend** confirmed by linear regression (Œ≤ ‚âà 3.98, p < 0.01).

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Seasonality and COVID-19 Effect

* Seasonal decomposition and **weekly season plots** confirmed recurring annual cycles.
* Introduced a **COVID dummy variable** (2020‚Äì2021 = 1) ‚Üí significant positive effect (Œ≤ ‚âà 42.8, p < 0.01).

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Stationarity and Differencing

* Applied **first differencing** and **seasonal differencing (lag = 52)** to remove trend and stabilize variance.
* Verified **stationarity** using the Augmented Dickey‚ÄìFuller (ADF) test (p < 0.01).

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ ARIMA Modeling

* Selected model by `auto.arima()`: **ARIMA(0,1,1)**.
* Captures short-term dependencies and non-stationary patterns efficiently.
* Produced forecasts for 2024, consistent with real data and within confidence intervals.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Residual Diagnostics

* Ljung‚ÄìBox tests on residuals and squared residuals show **no autocorrelation**.
* Confirms model adequacy before modeling volatility.

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ GARCH Modeling

* Fitted **GARCH(1,0)**, **GARCH(1,1)**, and **GARCH(2,1)** to model conditional variance.
* Selected **GARCH(1,1)** based on the lowest AIC (‚âà120.5).
* The model captures volatility clustering and heteroskedasticity effectively.

## üìà Key Results

| Model        | Description            |  AIC  | Notes                                                  |
| :----------- | :--------------------- | :---: | :----------------------------------------------------- |
| ARIMA(0,1,1) | Main forecasting model | 780.1 | Captures temporal structure and short-term correlation |
| GARCH(1,1)   | Volatility model       | 120.5 | Best representation of conditional variance            |

**Summary of insights:**

* Weekly mortality displays **trend + seasonal patterns** pre-COVID.
* COVID introduced a **structural disruption** (2020‚Äì2021).
* The ARIMA‚ÄìGARCH framework models both **mean dynamics** and **variance volatility** effectively.
